# Phase 4 ‚Äì Project Presentation


## üéØ Bowling Slot Reservation System


---

## üìù Project overview

The Bowling Slot Reservation System is a web-based application designed to provide a seamless way for users to book bowling lanes online. The platform allows users to sign up, log in, reserve lanes, view booking history, and manage their reservations.

**Target Users**
- Bowling enthusiasts looking for an easy way to book lanes.

- Casual players who want a hassle-free way to ensure lane availability before arrival.

**Context**
- The project aims to simplify bowling lane reservations, replacing inefficient manual booking methods.

- With the frontend deployed via Azure Static Web Apps, users can access the platform online without setting up locally.

- The backend is manually run by users and is not hosted on Azure.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Technical implementation



### Technologies Used
**Frontend**: React.js, TypeScript

**Backend**: Node.js, Express.js

**Database**: PostgreSQL (local setup, not cloud-hosted)

**Authentication**: LocalStorage session handling

**Hosting**: Azure Static Web Apps (only for frontend)

**Styling**: CSS

**Testing**: Postman, Playwright (E2E) & Vitest (Unit testing)

### Key Features & Implementation
**1.User Authentication**

- Users can register, log in, and maintain a session.

- Credentials are validated securely by the backend.

**2. Reservation System**

- Users book lanes with date, time, lanes, and duration selection.

- Bookings are stored in a local PostgreSQL database.

**3. Booking Management**

- Users can view past and upcoming reservations.

- Edits & cancellations are restricted within 24 hours of the scheduled time.

**4. Frontend Hosting via Azure**

- The React frontend is deployed using Azure Static Web Apps.

- Allows remote access to the application.

**5. Backend Execution**

- Backend runs manually using node server.js.

## üöÇ Development process

### Phase 1 - Planning
- Defined key use cases for booking, editing, and cancellation.

- Designed the database schema for users and reservations.

### Phase 2 - Initial Development
- Built the authentication system and login logic.

- Developed API endpoints for creating, retrieving, and managing reservations.

### Phase 3 - Feature Enhancements & Testing
- Implemented reservation filtering logic.

- Added restrictions for editing and canceling bookings.

- Conducted unit and E2E testing using Vitest and Playwright.

### Phase 4 - Deployment
- Azure Static Web Apps integration for frontend hosting.

- Backend remains locally executed instead of being hosted on Azure.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Reflection and future work

### What Worked Well
‚úî Frontend hosting via Azure enabled easy access.
‚úî Reservation management system implemented successfully. 
‚úî Playwright E2E testing validated core workflows effectively.

### Challenges Faced
‚ö†  Azure App Service backend integration was skipped due to preference for manual execution.
‚ö†  Database hosting was kept local, limiting cloud accessibility. 
‚ö†  Vitest and Playwright conflicts required debugging.

### Future Improvements
üöÄ Fully deploy backend on Azure App Service for remote access. 
üöÄ Migrate PostgreSQL to a cloud-hosted database. 
üöÄ Admin panel to manage and delete reservations.
